My pseudonym are Kaye or Kayla. I am currently living in Las Piñas City, Metro Manila I am an alumni of Metro Manila College (MMC), where our beloved Katipunan Tree lives, located in University Site, Brgy. Kaligayahan Novaliches, Quezon City. People who are existentialist, intellectuals, and are highly humorous, is what I like the most. On the contrary, I despise people who lie and betray, just to save themselves. I have a worthwile journey with my classmates who became be considerate, cooperative, and productive, as well as applied to my expectation for the Prof. Furthermore, this class became cooperative, not too overwhelming, while learning is benifitting.

Oh, hey! Stare, look how cute I am on this photo ^^

                            <p class="pre-wrap lead">
Human Anatomy and Physiology 2SBIO04 is a course subject that is deemed to cover the study that all human tissues, bodily organs, and organ systems are composed of cells, which are the basic building block of life. The study of understanding the composition and organization of living things is called anatomy. On the other side, biology is concerned with the internal systems and functions that support life.
                            <br>
These involve interactions between numerous elements and parts of our body on a biochemical and physical level respectively. As evolution progressed, species showed off increasingly sophisticated traits and abilities that helped human beings survive and prosper in their various environments.
                            <br>
By any terms, the functioning of the human body still remains a perplexing and complicated experience. As a pre-service teacher and student who will be sharing my journey with you about this course subject, I would like to start by saying that the course professor diligently embarked us the depth and breadth of each systems starting from integumentary system, skeletal system, muscular system; tongue, nose, and eyes, and ears; nervous system, the heart and blood, the lymphatic system, digestive system, circulatory system, reproductive system, and the endocrine system.
                            <br>
Our course started visiting the course migration plan, the class rules, file our learning contract, engage with the PNU Vision-Mission and Quality Policy Quiz, engaging and establishing first impression with our fellow classmates in Getting to Know You, through sharing each of our full name and nickname, where we are from at present, graduated from the indicated highschool including the general address, likes most dislikes, our last known GWA, expectation from this class, our presentation gadget/s used for remote learning, and our posted most charming picture.

                            <p class="pre-wrap lead">
Professor Belmi initiated the class to start to improvise or create a human body mosaic that shows bodily systems (digestive system, e.g.) with the use of materials at home. To this task, I used a flat styrofoam, paint brush, pencil, marker, 1 yard soft brown cardboard, color paint (poster paint), and cutting tools such as scissors and cutter/blade.
                            <br>
I started to clean the area, clean the clean styrofoam, prepare and arrange the color paints and the brush, as well as the cutting tools. Then I prepared the area where I can work properly. I drew esophagus, stomach, small intestines, large intestines, pancreas, ribs, uterus, fallopian tube,vagina, kidney, urethra, ureter, brain, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, lungs, trachea, and heart. I cut each one, painted, and let them dry. The styrofoam served as my canvas of blank human anatomy, painted with my desired color. Then after drying all needed organs, I assembled each, forming a mosaic of organs. I uploaded it to the designated Powerpoint Presentation in Google Drive, made by our class President, to be forwarded to the course professor.

                            <p class="pre-wrap lead">
The class started with an opening prayer, including the mandatory class attendance in our messenger group chat. Professor started to discuss the integumentary system in our google drive record attached at the end of this panel.                             <br>

                            <p class="pre-wrap lead">
The class was encouraged to perform a movie review by watching the series Bones 2005 episode 1 season 1. The murder case is about Cleo Louise Eller, who went missing two years ago from the time of the episode. The remains of the victim’s body, which are parts of her skeleton covered in a net, are found submerged under a pond, which was investigated upon. We were assigned to identify which part of the episode identified bone structures and key terminologies, which became significant in solving the criminal case. This part of the activity further guided us to pay attention to the terms that are related to bones or skeletal systems, and studying it is relevant to forensic anthropology, and in-depth research.

Our course professor added another group activity entitled Myogram in which we need to collaborate and work with different diseases that include origin, types, mechanism, prevention and cure. The assigned topic to us was Psoriasis, and we created a Powerpoint Presentation collecting all the information, pictures, and references, and was also uploaded to the LMS, and also to the Google Drive for duplication.

                            <p class="pre-wrap lead">
This is our third unit in our course which is deemed to focus on human senses such as auditory, gustatory, olfactory, and visual. We had a synchronous class and standard attendance checking as usual, and then proceeded to perform our class activity entitled Activity 4: Breakthroughs in Technology about Senses. Our group attentively assigned each member to form an open document file where  we can input our assigned part, and each member decided to distribute different senses, and I was assigned to work with the gustatory. It has two submissions, the first draft was allowed to have a 20% similarity index in creating a PDF document. The other one should be less than the previous similarity index. We submitted the first draft and got a final score of 75. After this topic, our class had midterms exams, where we had a quick agreement regarding the schedule available for everyone
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="page-section-heading2 text-secondary mb-0 d-inline-block">The Nervous System</h2>
                            <p class="pre-wrap lead">
Our class had a synchronous discussion, and after attendance, we had a collaborative quiz about the Nervous System where we acquired six (6) out of ten (10) points. For asynchronous activity, we were assigned to create Nerve Pathways, where we should create a nerve pathways of the assigned two (2) topics. The first general topic that each group should follow is Perception of piercing stones causing removal of feet from the point of contact (Somatosensation pathway), and the second topic the group decided to create a diagram for was the Perception of sun’s heat causing sweat glands to produce sweat (SNS Pathway-ANS). Unfortunately, we missed the instruction where we should individually create our own diagram each, instead we created only two diagrams, so we only gained 35 points out of 53. We learned here that it is okay to ask whether we missed any instructions before submitting the file, and if there are any revisions that should be done immediately to ensure quality of the paper.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="page-section-heading2 text-secondary mb-0 d-inline-block">The Endocrine System</h2>
                            <p class="pre-wrap lead">
We had a limited amount of time to have a class discussion regarding this topic, so our course professor conducted a poll wherein we needed to choose what topic she should record and discuss. The options were endocrine, digestive, and reproductive systems. The final result pointed with the digestive system.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="page-section-heading2 text-secondary mb-0 d-inline-block">The Cardio-Vascular System</h2>
                            <p class="pre-wrap lead">
Our professor initiated the class with attendance, and proceeded with the synchronous class discussion. We have two lessons under this topic namely, Lesson 6.1 The Heart and the Blood; and Lesson 6.2 Blood Vessels and Blood Circulation. Under Lesson 6.1, we had a group activity entitled ECG Analysis wherein we are needed to watch two given youtube videos entitled <br><br>Cardiac Conduction System: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZ4daFwMa8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZ4daFwMa8</a> <br><br>ECG: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FThXJUFWUrw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FThXJUFWUrw</a> <br><br>These helped us to understand and learn how to analyze ECG strips, including the QRS, the number of seconds per box in ECG strip. After watching these videos, we proceeded to analyze each of the two (2) strips, and answered each question. Each question was distributed among all members, and agreed to submit the paper upon revisions.                             </p>
                            <h2 class="page-section-heading2 text-secondary mb-0 d-inline-block">Digestive System</h2>
                            <p class="pre-wrap lead">
Since there is no remaining time for us to conduct a synchronous lesson, hence we had a poll to choose which our course professor recorded, uploaded to our Google Drive.

<br><br>The class was encouraged to perform a movie review by watching the series Bones 2005 episode 1 season 1. The murder case is about Cleo Louise Eller, who went missing two years ago from the time of the episode. The remains of the victim’s body, which are parts of her skeleton covered in a net, are found submerged under a pond, which was investigated upon. We were assigned to identify which part of the episode identified bone structures and key terminologies, which became significant in solving the criminal case. This part of the activity further guided us to pay attention to the terms that are related to bones or skeletal systems, and studying it is relevant to forensic anthropology, and in-depth research.
<br><br>Our course professor added another group activity entitled Myogram in which we need to collaborate and work with different diseases that include origin, types, mechanism, prevention and cure. The assigned topic to us was Psoriasis, and we created a Powerpoint Presentation collecting all the information, pictures, and references, and was also uploaded to the LMS, and also to the Google Drive for duplication.

<br><br>This is our third unit in our course which is deemed to focus on human senses such as auditory, gustatory, olfactory, and visual. We had a synchronous class and standard attendance checking as usual, and then proceeded to perform our class activity entitled Activity 4: Breakthroughs in Technology about Senses. Our group attentively assigned each member to form an open document file where  we can input our assigned part, and each member decided to distribute different senses, and I was assigned to work with the gustatory. It has two submissions, the first draft was allowed to have a 20% similarity index in creating a PDF document. The other one should be less than the previous similarity index. We submitted the first draft and got a final score of 75. After this topic, our class had midterms exams, where we had a quick agreement regarding the schedule available for everyone.

<br><br>Our class had a synchronous discussion, and after attendance, we had a collaborative quiz about the Nervous System where we acquired six (6) out of ten (10) points. For asynchronous activity, we were assigned to create Nerve Pathways, where we should create a nerve pathways of the assigned two (2) topics. The first general topic that each group should follow is Perception of piercing stones causing removal of feet from the point of contact (Somatosensation pathway), and the second topic the group decided to create a diagram for was the Perception of sun’s heat causing sweat glands to produce sweat (SNS Pathway-ANS). Unfortunately, we missed the instruction where we should individually create our own diagram each, instead we created only two diagrams, so we only gained 35 points out of 53. We learned here that it is okay to ask whether we missed any instructions before submitting the file, and if there are any revisions that should be done immediately to ensure quality of the paper.

<br><br>Our professor initiated the class with attendance, and proceeded with the synchronous class discussion. We have two lessons under this topic namely, Lesson 6.1 The Heart and the Blood; and Lesson 6.2 Blood Vessels and Blood Circulation. Under Lesson 6.1, we had a group activity entitled ECG Analysis wherein we are needed to watch two given youtube videos entitled Cardiac Conduction System:       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZ4daFwMa8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZ4daFwMa8</a> and ECG    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FThXJUFWUrw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FThXJUFWUrw</a>, These helped us to understand and learn how to analyze ECG strips, including the QRS, the number of seconds per box in ECG strip. After watching these videos, we proceeded to analyze each of the two (2) strips, and answered each question. Each question was distributed among all members, and agreed to submit the paper upon revisions.

<br><br>Professor Belmi initiated the class to start to improvise or create a human body mosaic that shows bodily systems (digestive system, e.g.) with the use of materials at home. To this task, I used a flat styrofoam, paint brush, pencil, marker, 1 yard soft brown cardboard, color paint (poster paint), and cutting tools such as scissors and cutter/blade.
<br><br>I started to clean the area, clean the clean styrofoam, prepare and arrange the color paints and the brush, as well as the cutting tools. Then I prepared the area where I can work properly. I drew esophagus, stomach, small intestines, large intestines, pancreas, ribs, uterus, fallopian tube,vagina, kidney, urethra, ureter, brain, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, lungs, trachea, and heart. I cut each one, painted, and let them dry. The styrofoam served as my canvas of blank human anatomy, painted with my desired color. Then after drying all needed organs, I assembled each, forming a mosaic of organs. I uploaded it to the designated Powerpoint Presentation in Google Drive, made by our class President, to be forwarded to the course professor.
